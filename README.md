# KOBDIG
KOBDIG stands for Knowledge, Obligations, Beliefs, Desires, Intentions, and Goals.

The purpose of the KOBDIG project, which is still under construction, is to demonstrate the capabilities of an integrated framework for cognitive agents, based on possibility theory, that extends the BDI agent model.

The framework enables an agent to form its beliefs about the world according to input provided by partially trusted sources and to generate its desires and goals based on its beliefs and on user-provided desire-generation rules.

A more rigorous description of the framework is given in Célia da Costa Pereira and Andrea G. B. Tettamanzi. "An Integrated Possibilistic Framework for Goal Generation in Cognitive Agents". In Proceedings of the 9th International conference on autonomous agents and multiagent systems (AAMAS 2010), pages 1239–1246.
